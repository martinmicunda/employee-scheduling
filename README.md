## Architecture Diagram
###<a name="diagram-development"></a>Development
![Development Architecture Diagram](employee-scheduling-development.png "Development Architecture Diagram")

This architecture is running on my Macbook Pro. The laptop runs Vagrant  with three Docker containers (`UI` for static assets, `API` for Node.js application and `DB` for Couchbase database). The Docker provider allows Vagrant to manage development environments that run within containers, rather than virtual machines. This works without any additional software required on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. On platforms that don't support Linux Containers natively such as Mac OS X and Windows, Vagrant is smart enough to detect these cases and automatically spins up a Linux virtual machine to run the Docker containers. Vagrant then shares this virtual machine for all Docker-based development environments with Vagrant. That means with just a single virtual machine, Vagrant can manage many Docker environments.

##<a name="installation-and-configuration"></a> Installation & Configuration
###<a name="platform-and-tools"></a> Platform & Tools
You need to have installed follow tools on your machine:

- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) 4.3.16+
- [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) 1.7.2+
- [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html) 1.8.2+

###<a name="installation"></a> Installation

**1.** Clone main repository:
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:martinmicunda/employee-scheduling.git 
$ cd employee-scheduling
```

**2.** Clone submodule repositories:
```bash
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

**3.** The following command would add a new `ubuntu trusty64 box`, and if an existing one is found, it will override it:

```bash
$ vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty64 --force
```
>**NOTE:** This process may take a while, as most Vagrant boxes will be at least **200 MB** big.

Verify that box was installed by running the `list` subcommand that will list the boxes installed within Vagrant along with the provider that backs the box:

```bash
$ vagrant box list
ubuntu/trusty64  (virtualbox, 14.04)
```
**4.** The following command would install a `vagrant plugins` for this project, and if an existing one is found, it will override it:

```bash
$ bash bin/vagrant-install-plugins.sh
```
Verify that vagrant plugins were installed by running the `list` subcommand that will list the installed roles:

```bash
$ vagrant plugin list
vagrant-hostmanager (1.5.0)
```
 
**5.** The following command would install an `ansible roles` for this project, and if an existing one is found, it will override it:

```bash
$ bash bin/ansible-install-roles.sh
```
Verify that ansible roles were installed by running the `list` subcommand that will list the installed roles:

```bash
$ ansible-galaxy list
martinmicunda.bower, v1.0.0
martinmicunda.common, v1.0.0
martinmicunda.gulp, v1.0.0
martinmicunda.nodejs, v1.0.1
martinmicunda.iojs, v1.0.0
laggyluke.direnv, v2.5.0
```
**6.** Now, run `vagrant up` that will create `3 Docker containers` and provisioning each of these containers. 

```bash
$ vagrant up
```
>**NOTE:** **Vagrant will provision the virtual machine only once on the first run, any subsequent provisioning must be executed with the** `--provision` **flag either** `vagrant up --provision` **or** `vagrant reload --provision` **. The provisioning will re-run also if you destroy the VM and rebuild it with** `vagrant destroy` **and** `vagrant up` **.**

If there have been no errors when executing the above commands, the machines  `ui`, `api` and `db` should be created. The following command would outputs status of the vagrant machine:

```bash
$ vagrant status
Current machine states:
ui                        running (virtualbox)
api                       running (virtualbox)
db                        running (virtualbox)
```
Now you should be able to ssh into any of those boxes:
```bash
$ vagrant ssh ui   # ssh to ui server
$ vagratn ssh api  # ssh to api server
$ vagrant ssh db   # ssh to db server
```
To make it easier to type, following aliases have been added to your `/etc/hosts` file:
```
192.168.33.10   ui www.dev.employee-scheduling.com dev.employee-scheduling.com
192.168.33.14   nsqadmin www.nsq.employee-scheduling.com nsq.employee-scheduling.com
192.168.33.16   consul www.consul.employee-scheduling.com consul.employee-scheduling.com
```
Finally, open up your browser and navigate to [http://dev.employee-scheduling.com](http://dev.employee-scheduling.com) or [http://192.168.33.10](http://192.168.33.10) to connect to your local environment.

## Running App
### Development
To start the server you need to ssh into `api` box:
```bash
$ vagrant ssh api
$ cd api
$ npm start
```
Open up your browser and navigate to [http://dev.employee-scheduling.com](http://dev.employee-scheduling.com) or [http://192.168.33.10](http://192.168.33.10) to connect to your local environment.

>**NOTE:** **The [direnv](http://direnv.net/) is use as an environment variable manager so when you first time cd into api  directory with a `.envrc` file, it will refuse to load the file. This is to protect you, since the contents of the .envrc will be executed by your shell, and they might come from untrusted sources. Simply run `direnv allow`, and it will trust that file until the next time it changes.**

### Debugging
To start the server in debugging mode you need to ssh into `api` box:
```bash
$ vagrant ssh api -- -L 5858:127.0.0.1:5858 #setup ssh proxy to VM
$ cd api
$ npm start -- --debug server.js # start server in debug mode
```
Run the following from your HOST machine, not your vagrant box:
```bash
$ telnet 127.0.0.1 5858
```
You should get a response like: 
```bash
Type: connect
V8-Version: 3.14.5.9
Protocol-Version: 1
Embedding-Host: node v0.10.28
Content-Length: 0
```
Now you can debugging `api` node.js session remotely using [WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) or [Node Inspector](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector).

## Vagrant 
There’s a ton of commands you can use to talk to Vagrant. For a full list see the [official docs](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/cli/), but here are the more common ones.

* `vagrant up` - use this command to `start` your virtual environment
* `vagrant halt` - use this command to `stop` your virtual environment
* `vagrant suspend` - use this command to `pause` your virtual environment, make sure you do this before shutting down your computer to safely be able to restore the environment later.
* `vagrant destroy` - use this command to `removes` your virtual environment from your machine
* `vagrant reload` - use this command to `reload` your virtual environment, if you add the `--provision` flag, it will reprovision the box as well; this is useful with removing or adding things to the server via Ansible.
* `vagrant ssh` - use this command to `connect` to the virtual server
* `vagrant provision` - use this command to `provision` running Vagrant machine

## Ansible
To get better understanding how Ansible works check the [official docs](http://docs.ansible.com/). Ansible installs the following software:

* **UI box:**
	* git
	* node.js
	* npm
	* nginx
	* gulp
	* bower
* **API box:**
	* git
	* node.js
	* npm
	* gulp
* **DB box:**
	* git 
	* couchbase

The `couchbase` and `nginx` services are started after provisioning takes place.

## Versioning

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch

## FAQ
### What if I want to uninstall application?
**1.** The following command would permanently removes the `web`, `api` and `db` virtual boxes from your machine:
```bash
$ vagrant destroy
```
**2.** The following command would uninstall an `ansible roles` for this project:
```bash
$ bash bin/ansible-uninstall-roles.sh
```
**3.** The following command would uninstall a `vagrant plugins` for this project:
```bash
$ bash bin/vagrant-uninstall-plugins.sh
```
**4.** The following command would remove  `trusty64 box`:
```bash
$ vagrant box remove trusty64
```
###What if I want a fresh install?
If you wish to destroy the `web`, `api` and `db` virtual boxes to make sure you have a fresh start, you can do these steps:
```bash
 $ vagrant destroy 
 $ vagrant up
```

###What if I want different IP addresses for my hosts with Vagrant?
In the [`Vagrantfile`](Vagrantfile) you find this section:

    servers = {
                "ui"  => "192.168.33.10",
                "api" => "192.168.33.11",
                "db"  => "192.168.33.12",
              }

This is where the IP addresses of the machines are defined. You can change those to some other private addresses that you may prefer.

Please note that you will also have to edit the [`inventories/development`](inventories/development) file,
specfically this section:

	[all-hosts]
	ui  ansible_ssh_host=192.168.33.10
	api ansible_ssh_host=192.168.33.11
	db  ansible_ssh_host=192.168.33.12

Adjust the IP addresses to whatever values you have chosen in [`Vagrantfile`](Vagrantfile).
